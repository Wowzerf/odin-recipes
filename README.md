# odin-recipes
I'm building a basic website that will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

The skills I demonstrated :

* Able to understand how an HTML structure worked by using tags in the correct manner most of the time
* Look back at the previous lessons and apply to my code
* Used the terminal to organize my files in the right directory so that they can work effectively 
* Started to understand how to use Git for adding, staging, and commits for my files 
* Made sure to check my code and resolved an issue with the way I closed the anchor tag
* I organized my code so that it could be readable for others or my future self
